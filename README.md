# x1627

A bot that emulates the [XKCD comic 1627](http://xkcd.com/1627/).

This bot will find a random sub and look for "fake" or "no way" and then respond in 1 of 4 ways:

1. woosh
2. Comment of the year
3. Are you for real
4. I'm taking a screenshot so I can remember this moment forever

It also responds to direct messages or replies by looking for words within the reply that matches a title from one of the XKCD comics and the responds with the alt text
